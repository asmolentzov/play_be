# Play

## Introduction
Play is a paired project for Module 4 of the [Back-End Engineering Program](https://turing.io/programs/back-end-engineering/) at the [Turing School of Software & Design](https://turing.io/). The project specifications can be found [here](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects/play/play). Play is a full-stack application built using a Node.js backend with an Express server and a JavaScript frontend. The API has full CRUD functionality built in. Additionally, this repository uses the MVC design pattern for clarity and maintainability and includes a test suite built with Mocha and Chai. Finally, the frontend also calls the MusixMatch API to retrieve song information more information on how to set that up is found on the frontend documentation. [This repo](https://github.com/asmolentzov/play_be) is the Play BE. You can find the [frontend repo here](https://github.com/asmolentzov/play_fe).
